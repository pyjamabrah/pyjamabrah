# Refund Policy

Thank you for purchasing one of our online courses! We strive to deliver high-quality content and ensure your satisfaction. Please read our refund policy carefully before making a purchase, as it outlines the conditions under which refunds may be granted.

## 1. General Refund Eligibility

Refunds are only available under specific circumstances. To be eligible, `you must submit a refund request within 5 hours of your purchase` by contacting us at support@pyjamabrah.com. Requests made after this period will not be considered.

## 2. Legitimate Refund Requests

We will issue a full refund if:
- The course content is inaccessible due to a technical issue on our end (e.g., broken links) and we are unable to resolve the issue within 5 working days of your report.
- You were charged incorrectly (e.g., duplicate charges or an amount different from the listed price at the time of purchase).

To process such requests, we may ask for evidence (e.g., screenshots or a detailed description) to verify the issue. To expedite the process, you can send the transaction details along with the initial email.

## 3. Non-Refundable Circumstances

We do not offer refunds for the following reasons:
- **Change of Mind**: If you decide the course isn't for you after purchase, no refund will be provided. We encourage you to review course descriptions, previews, and testimonials before buying.
- **Price Changes or Discounts**: Our course prices may fluctuate due to promotions, discounts, or updates. Purchasing a course at one price does not entitle you to a refund or partial refund if the price changes later.
- **Partial Completion**: If you have accessed or completed any portion of the course, it is considered consumed, and no refund will be issued.
- **Failure to Engage**: Not starting or completing the course within a certain timeframe does not qualify you for a refund.

## 4. Discount Purchases

Courses bought at a discounted rate (e.g., during a sale or with a coupon) are final sales and not eligible for refunds unless a technical issue (as described in Section 2) prevents access.

## 5. Process and Approval

All refund requests will be reviewed within 5-7 business days. If approved, the refund will be processed. We reserve the right to deny any request that does not meet the criteria outlined above.

# Reach Us
