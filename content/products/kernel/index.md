## Course Highlights

- **Hands-On Approach**: Follow along with practical, real-time demonstrations of each step, from source code to a running system.
- **ARM64 Focus**: Target the ARM64 architecture, widely used in modern devices like servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems.
- **Minimalist Userspace with BusyBox**: Learn to create a compact and efficient userspace to complement your kernel.
- **QEMU Virtualization**: Harness the power of QEMU to test and experiment without needing physical hardware.
- **Expert Guidance**: Benefit from clear explanations and best practices for kernel development and system emulation.

By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills and confidence to build, configure, and run your own Linux kernel on an ARM64 QEMU virtual machine, complete with a BusyBox-based userspace.
