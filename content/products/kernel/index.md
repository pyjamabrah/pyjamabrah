      faqs:
        - q: "What is the difference between this course (paid) and the videos on YouTube?"
          a: "Only few initial videos are put on YouTube. The Full course has many more videos and is a paid offering. Learners will also have access to the notes, source code files and other resources."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Is this course good for beginners?"
          a: "Yes! The course is taught as if the learner has no idea about the C programming language."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Why is the course validity 365 days?"
          a: "We need to maintain the servers that host the courses. At the moment we have enough capital to keep the server afloat for another until. We are striving to make this a lifetime access course. As the funds trickle in, we will revisit the validity and might update it for all the enrolled learners."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Do I need a special machine configuration to take this course?"
          a: "No! All you will need is an internet connection and the Chrome browser. The hands-on examples and lab work is based on GitHub codespaces platform."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Why is a GitHub account needed?"
          a: "The Experiments and Labs are based on the GitHub provided Codespaces virtual machine. Codespaces will enable a common work environment for all the learners and avoid the hassle of special setup."

        - q: "How will the open-source contribution work?"
          a: "We will host few github repos under pyjamabrah with the skeleton code and details asks (in comments) about the subsequent tasks. You can add the code (with your details in the comment if you'd want), create PR (pull-request) and submit. We will review and merge your PR into main."

        - q: "Will this course be added to `Firmware Engineer's Arsenal`?"
          a: "No! This is a separate offering and unrelated to my previous work at inpyjama.com. pyjamabrah is exclusively run by me and independent of continuous collaboration with my team."
