          a: "No! All you will need is an internet connection and the Chrome browser. The hands-on examples and lab work is based on GitHub codespaces platform. We use GitHub Codespace to ensure that you don't struggle with the setup and focus on the learnings. You are always free to setup the environment locally. Although, we won't support that, but you are free to do so. The courses, as much possible use a Emulator target of a real board, so if you wanted to run the code on real board. You can do so."

## How to learn Firmware Development

Every embedded system has a CPU with firmware running on it. Being able to master Firmware engineering comes down to mastering the following -

![](/fw/how-to.png "High level view of the courses in this pack!")

### 1. C Language

`C` is the workhorse when it comes to firmware. While there are languages like Rust and C++ that can be used, C is still the dominant language. Primarily because of the ease with which the hardware can be manipulated. Mastering C is must.

The `C Language` course will guide you through hands on experiments using the RISC-V CPU emulated using QEMU. You will learn the basics of Assembly, RISC-V instruction set, how to boot the CPU, Precondition to be full-filled before the CPU can run machine code generated as a result of the C code. **The goal is to enable you precisely predict what the CPU will do as a result of the line of C code!**

`C Pointer` and `C - Bit Manipulation` are focused on hammering home how pointers and bit-manipulation are used. While the `C Language` course covers, these two tracks focus on demonstrating the use.

`Data Structures (in C)` is a dedicated to showing how various data-structures are implemented using the C language and how to use them in design.

### 2. Tools and Utilities

Knowing how to write C code is the bare minimum, being able to automate the build and control the placement of code in memory banks is a non-negotiable for a firmware engineer. These two topics are covered exclusively in the `GNU Make` and `GNU Linker Scripts` courses.

Besides these, almost always, there is a need to debug the firmware - the course on `GDB` covers the details of debugging firmware on a hardware target.

### 3. CPU - ARM Cortex-M

Every firmware engineer should know a CPU architecture end-to-end. We chose ARM Cortex-M. These are the most popular 32-Bit CPUs on the planet at the moment.

`ARM Cortex-M (101)` introduces the ARM M line of CPUs and the programming model making you comfortable with how the CPU boots, how it handles interrupts and how it interacts with the memory. This course is focused on making you comfortable and confident about find the information you need about this architecture.

The `ARM Cortex-M (102) - Scheduler Design using Assembly` focuses on guiding you through the assembly instructions available to program the M class CPUs. The types of assembly instructions and how to write assembly programs using them. To deepen your understanding of the programmer's model of the CPU and the exception handling, the course ends with you implementing a scheduler to switch between two assembly programs. **This project is deliberate and opens the door to learning operating systems**.

### 4. Operating Systems

The CPUs in Embedded Systems are responsible for driving the system from one state to another. The states are managed in firmware and often there is a separate software sequence managing individual state machine (if there is more than one).

The firmware then is based on an RTOS. We picked FreeRTOS and Zephyr because they are very popular. The `FreeRTOS - Teardown and Porting` course is focused on diving into the details of how the RTOS boots and how you can enable it on a new board/target. This course builds on the Scheduler implementation in assembly from the `ARM Cortex-M (102)` course and uses the insights to explain the implementation of the FreeRTOS kernel.

The course on Zephyr, focuses on introducing the OS and how to get it going.

### 5. Other helpful skills

When developing a firmware, you will usually work with a team. The course on `Git/Gerrit` explain how **git** version control can be used for effective collaboration.

All too often there is also some automation using Python involved, the course on `Python Programming` focuses on demonstrating how python is used. As part of this course, you will learn the object-oriented programming by comparing the language constructs to C.

Finally, the `FPGA based Hardware Design (101)` is to introduce you to the world of hardware engineering and how digital logic is designed. At the end of this course, you will be able to think and reason very clearly about the code you write and how the hardware reacts as a result.

## Hardware

The courses are based on the emulation target for `ST32VLDISCOVERY` available in QEMU. Getting the hardware is not strictly require, but if you do so - we recommend you setup the environment locally on a linux machine.
