          description: "You’ll trade confusion for clarity in under an hour. Instead of dry definitions, you’ll lock in a single, vivid mental image that turns every pointer into something you can literally see on a whiteboard or sketch on a napkin. You’ll discover what a pointer truly is (spoiler: it’s not just “a variable holding an address”), why the Linux kernel, FreeRTOS, Zephyr, and every serious RTOS lean on them like oxygen, and the three everyday firmware disasters that disappear once pointers click. By the end, you’ll explain pointers to a five-year-old!"

By the time you finish, the difference between a pointer variable and the memory it guards will feel as natural as breathing, and you’ll never again mix up “value” versus “address” in your sleep. No slides, no theory—just you, a terminal, and the exact four lines of code that make every kernel tick."

# The Design and Deliberation

I am a big believer of mental models and visualisations when it comes to learning technical concepts. This course is deliberately heavy on insight and frameworks of thinking about pointers.

**Pointers** in C is a straight forward concept but it has earned a reputation for being hard to understand. In my opinion, the problem is - most of those who try and learn pointers don't understand how and what to imagine and reason based off of.

From the very first lecture, you'll notice that I explain key concepts with visualisation and mental models along with a hands on experiment to prove the point. The course is loaded with insights that will empower you to your pointers like a pro!
