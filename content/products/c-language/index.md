# The Design and Deliberation

The internet is flooded with coding courses—yet none rival this. For over a decade, C has been my daily driver at work. Unlike kernel developers leaning on abstractions, I’ve wielded C in its purest, most raw form—programming CPUs from scratch, without the crutch of standard libraries. This course hands you that same unfiltered power. By the end, you won’t just know C—you’ll command it like a seasoned pro, bending it to your will in ways most developers never dream of.

Here’s the truth: **C’s mastery runs deeper than most realize**. The general public and students rarely glimpse its full scope from the sidelines. I’ve lived it, and now I’m pulling back the curtain for you.
