      description: "**Note: This course is already included in the [Library Access](/library)!**\n\nLearn FreeRTOS kernel by tearing it down to it's bare minimum and doing a port for a new target from scratch. This includes booting the CPU from scratch and placing the code in memory manually. Along the way, learn the internals of how the OS is structured and how it works."

# What is so special about this course?

There are several courses online that dive into how to use FreeRTOS. This one take a different approach and dives into the internals of FreeRTOS and how to port it from scratch on a new micro-controller. Learning it this way will ensure that you understand the internals of this RTOS and reason better when using it.
