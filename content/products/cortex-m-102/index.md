      subtitle: "`Learn arm cortex-m controller assembly programming`"
      description: "**Note: This course is already included in the [Library Access](/library)!**\n\nLearn the assembly programming for ARM Cortex-M CPUs by writing a scheduler from scratch, without using any IDE, SDK or boiler plate code. A scheduler is at the heart of every operating system.\n\n By writing one from scratch, not only will you learn how to write assembly code, but also how the CPU works and, how a single CPU can run more than one process. As part of this course, the goal is to make a single CPU run three infinite `while(1){}` loops!"

# What is so special about this course?

Every complex embedded systems solution uses an OS/RTOS for implementing the state machine. An OS at its core implements a task scheduler (among other things). Not everyone understands how it works.

The design of this course is deliberate in the sense that - in an attempt to implementing the "Scheduler" you will learn the CPU operations, how assembly programs are written and how scheduling works.

Completing this course should set you up to understand & work efficiently with an operating system (like the FreeRTOS).
