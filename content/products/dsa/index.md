          review: "the course gives exactly what I wanted to here. I had some experience with DSA but still I felt there are some dots I couldn't connect, this helped me figure out a lot of stuff and now i can say am good in DSA only a lot of test and leetcode problems need so I can master the content i just learnt"

          review: "Dear Pyjama Brah Team, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my appreciation for the Data Structures lessons, particularly the clear and well-structured explanations of linked lists and queues. The content has been very helpful in strengthening my understanding of these core concepts. However, I was expecting coverage of circular buffer topics as part of this module or upcoming lessons and I believe their inclusion would add great value to the course. I would be grateful if you could consider adding these concepts or let me know if they will be covered in a future lesson. Thank you for your excellent work and continued support in our learning journey."

      faqs:
        - q: "What is the difference between this course (paid) and the videos on YouTube?"
          a: "Only few initial videos are put on YouTube. The Full course has many more videos and is a paid offering. Learners will also have access to the notes, source code files and other resources."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Is this course good for beginners?"
          a: "Yes! The course is taught as if the learner has no idea about the C programming language."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Why is the course validity 365 days?"
          a: "We need to maintain the servers that host the courses. At the moment we have enough capital to keep the server afloat for another until. We are striving to make this a lifetime access course. As the funds trickle in, we will revisit the validity and might update it for all the enrolled learners."

        - q: "Do I need a special machine configuration to take this course?"
          a: "No! All you will need is an internet connection and the Chrome browser. The hands-on examples and lab work is based on GitHub codespaces platform."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Why is a GitHub account needed?"
          a: "The Experiments and Labs are based on the GitHub provided Codespaces virtual machine. Codespaces will enable a common work environment for all the learners and avoid the hassle of special setup."

# The Design and Deliberation

The internet is flooded with coding coursesâ€”yet none rival this. For over a decade, C has been my daily driver at work. Unlike kernel developers leaning on abstractions, Iâ€™ve wielded C in its purest, most raw formâ€”programming CPUs from scratch, without the crutch of standard libraries. This course hands you that same unfiltered power. By the end, you wonâ€™t just know Câ€”youâ€™ll command it like a seasoned pro, bending it to your will in ways most developers never dream of.

Hereâ€™s the truth: **Câ€™s mastery runs deeper than most realize**. The general public and students rarely glimpse its full scope from the sidelines. Iâ€™ve lived it, and now Iâ€™m pulling back the curtain for you.
