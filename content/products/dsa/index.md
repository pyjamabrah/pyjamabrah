          review: "the course gives exactly what I wanted to here. I had some experience with DSA but still I felt there are some dots I couldn't connect, this helped me figure out a lot of stuff and now i can say am good in DSA only a lot of test and leetcode problems need so I can master the content i just learnt"

          review: "Dear Pyjama Brah Team, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my appreciation for the Data Structures lessons, particularly the clear and well-structured explanations of linked lists and queues. The content has been very helpful in strengthening my understanding of these core concepts. However, I was expecting coverage of circular buffer topics as part of this module or upcoming lessons and I believe their inclusion would add great value to the course. I would be grateful if you could consider adding these concepts or let me know if they will be covered in a future lesson. Thank you for your excellent work and continued support in our learning journey."

      faqs:
        - q: "What is the difference between this course (paid) and the videos on YouTube?"
          a: "Only few initial videos are put on YouTube. The Full course has many more videos and is a paid offering. Learners will also have access to the notes, source code files and other resources."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Is this course good for beginners?"
          a: "Yes! The course is taught as if the learner has no idea about the C programming language."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Why is the course validity 365 days?"
          a: "We need to maintain the servers that host the courses. At the moment we have enough capital to keep the server afloat for another until. We are striving to make this a lifetime access course. As the funds trickle in, we will revisit the validity and might update it for all the enrolled learners."

        - q: "Do I need a special machine configuration to take this course?"
          a: "No! All you will need is an internet connection and the Chrome browser. The hands-on examples and lab work is based on GitHub codespaces platform."
          open: "open"
        - q: "Why is a GitHub account needed?"
          a: "The Experiments and Labs are based on the GitHub provided Codespaces virtual machine. Codespaces will enable a common work environment for all the learners and avoid the hassle of special setup."

# The Design and Deliberation

The internet is flooded with coding courses—yet none rival this. For over a decade, C has been my daily driver at work. Unlike kernel developers leaning on abstractions, I’ve wielded C in its purest, most raw form—programming CPUs from scratch, without the crutch of standard libraries. This course hands you that same unfiltered power. By the end, you won’t just know C—you’ll command it like a seasoned pro, bending it to your will in ways most developers never dream of.

Here’s the truth: **C’s mastery runs deeper than most realize**. The general public and students rarely glimpse its full scope from the sidelines. I’ve lived it, and now I’m pulling back the curtain for you.
