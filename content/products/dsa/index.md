          review: "the course gives exactly what I wanted to here. I had some experience with DSA but still I felt there are some dots I couldn't connect, this helped me figure out a lot of stuff and now i can say am good in DSA only a lot of test and leetcode problems need so I can master the content i just learnt"

          review: "Dear Pyjama Brah Team, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my appreciation for the Data Structures lessons, particularly the clear and well-structured explanations of linked lists and queues. The content has been very helpful in strengthening my understanding of these core concepts. However, I was expecting coverage of circular buffer topics as part of this module or upcoming lessons and I believe their inclusion would add great value to the course. I would be grateful if you could consider adding these concepts or let me know if they will be covered in a future lesson. Thank you for your excellent work and continued support in our learning journey."

# The Design and Deliberation

As the embedded software gets more nuanced, the answer to performance and reliability usually becomes clever organization of the data and algorithms that leverage that organization. This course is designed with a focus on development in the C language. Special attention is paid to explaining the concepts of C and ways of thinking/reasoning intuitively.
