Hey there!

My name is Piyush Itankar. By profession, I am an Embedded Systems, Software Engineer and currently working at Google India.

I am passionate about studying electricity and use that as a way to understand the world around me. How we can make inanimate matter do our bidding is something that has always fascinated me and leaves me in awe every time I think about it.

I am deeply interested in exploring the `grey matter between the abstraction layers` and this blog documents the technical exploration `from the transistor to AI`.
