Hey There!

[Mahmad Bharmal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmadbharmal/) and [Piyush Itankar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/streetdogg/) are Embedded Systems Engineers. They started Pyjamabrah with the goal of `Lowering the barrier to learning Embedded Systems`.

Learning embedded systems can be daunting task. The information available on the internet is scattered and not always explained in ways that a beginner can understand and turn into a reliable skill. The team has been through that journey and it took them a decade to feel confident. A lot of time could have been saved had the information been organized in one place and presented in a structured manner.

With Pyjamabrah, the effort is to organize reliable information in one place. As part of that the team offers [structured courses](/courses), has a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@pyjamabrah) and maintain a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MkWTQjJDD2).
