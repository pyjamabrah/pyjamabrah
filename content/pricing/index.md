At `Typobrahe Education LLP` (pyjamacafe.com), we strive to deliver high-quality online courses on Embedded Systems that provide exceptional value to our learners. To ensure we can continue to meet your needs and adapt to changing circumstances, our pricing policy is designed with flexibility in mind. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Dynamic Pricing**: We reserve the right to adjust course prices at any time, without prior notice. Prices may increase or decrease based on various factors, including market conditions, course updates, or operational considerations. The price you see at the time of purchase is the price you’ll pay for that transaction.

- **Discounts and Promotions**: From time to time, we may offer discounts or special promotions to make our courses more accessible. These offers are temporary and subject to change or discontinuation at our discretion. Keep an eye out for these opportunities!

- **Value-Based Pricing**: Our course prices reflect what we believe represents their worth—based on the expertise, effort, and resources invested in creating them, as well as the value they deliver to you as a learner.

We appreciate your understanding of our approach to pricing. If you have any questions about our courses or current pricing, feel free to reach out to us at [support@pyjamacafe.com](mailto:support@pyjamacafe.com).
